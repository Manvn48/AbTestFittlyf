#  Streamlit app to perform an AB test
<br>
After providing the necessary inputs, the app will perform an AB test using the function ab_test and display the result,
indicating whether the experiment group is better, the control group is better, or if the test is inconclusive based on the chosen confidence level.
This provides a straightforward way for users to analyze the results of their hypothesis test.
